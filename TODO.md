TODO: rewrite the README ðŸ™‚
TODO: maybe (?) add a config file to make it easier to change settings without editing the code (basically a theme system to pair font, image template, insert sizes)
~~TODO: printable frame~~
   (well... I have one but it's hacked together from other models)
~~TODO: button handling~~
  (TODO: update button handling)
TODO: maximise size for image frame (could increase the projector screen size and reduce mascot size)
TODO: command line arguments for settings to set template, choose timeline, etc.
TODO: figure out what to do if the alt text is really long (maybe truncate it and add ellipsis?)
TODO: add a label maybe bottom edge of the frame to show what kind of timeline is being displayed
