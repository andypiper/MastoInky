TODO: maybe (?) add a config file to make it easier to change settings without editing the code (basically a theme system to pair font, image template, insert sizes)
~~TODO: printable frame~~
   (well... I have one but it's hacked together from other models)
~~TODO: button handling~~
  (TODO: update button handling)
